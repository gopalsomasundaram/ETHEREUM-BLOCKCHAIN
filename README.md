# ETHEREUM-BLOCKCHAIN
Building a decentralization application  to store and retrieve data.
The problem it solves:
We are  going to build  a decentralization application  to store and retrieve data.  The front end will be developed with the help of html, CSS and JavaScript .  We will connect  our front end to MetaMask to connect It to Ethereum blockchain in which we are going to store the user data. This technology helps us   to   establish trust without a central authority and make   transaction more  efficient. 

Follow the following steps to execute this code:
to execute this program you need to already have MetaMask account, switch to a test server in the MetaMask account through the advanced setting and then get ethereum for the respective server using the respective servers faucet.
we used sepolioEth as the currency for our development.

Then you need to open an IDE to upload the given solidity code named smartcontract.sol
we recommend using the REMIX ethereum IDE (http://remix.ethereum.org/) as we also used it for the development of this project.
copy paste the solidity code and deploy it, **MAKE SURE TO COPY THE ADDRESS OF THE DEPLOYED SMART CONTRACT.**

Now open an IDE to run the HTML code on.
**IN THE HTML CODE YOU HAVE TO PASTE THE ADDRESS OF THE SMART CONTRACT**.
Then after you run it and open the html website make sure your MetaMask is connected to the webpage.

Then you can freely use the website to store product details and retreive them using just any one of the information you had previously enjoyed.

We hope you enjoyed our project for the byteVerse hackathon and we thank you for you patience and taking time to review out project.
